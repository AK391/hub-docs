<h1>Models</h1>

The Hugging Face Hub hosts a large number of models that can be used for a variety of [machine learning tasks](TODO: Link to TASKS). Since models are stored in repositories, each model repo benefits from [all of the features](./repositories-main) that every repo on the Hugging Face Hub comes with. Additionally, model repos have a suite of features that make exploring and using models as easy as possible.
