<h1>Models</h1>

The Hugging Face Hub hosts a large number of models that can be used for a [variety of machine learning tasks](https://huggingface.co/tasks). Since models are stored in repositories, each model repo benefits from [all of the features](./repositories-main) that every repo on the Hugging Face Hub comes with. Additionally, model repos have a suite of features that make exploring and using models as easy as possible. These docs will take you through everything you'll need to know to find models on the Hub, upload your own models, and make the most of everything the Model Hub has to offer!
